# Hack Project
This is the project done by Amber Su, Brooke Ye, Maggie Chen, and Sarah Zhong at **BigRed Hacks 2024**.

**Pomopals** is a global Pomodoro timer web app that allows users to stay productive together. The app follows the Pomodoro technique, where users work for 25 minutes on their own tasks and then take a 5-minute break to chat and relax with others. Users can write to-do lists to keep themselves accountable and check in on others' progress. When the timer runs out, a chime alerts the user, and the global chat is opened, allowing everyone to socialize during the break.

We built pomopals using **Next.js** for the frontend and **MongoDB** for the backend. We chose Next.js because of its scalability and server-side rendering capabilities, allowing us to handle real-time features such as global timers and chats. MongoDB was selected as the database due to its flexibility and ease of integration for storing user tasks, chats, and other data.
